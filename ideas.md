## Idea 1: Industrial Blueprint Aesthetic
<text>
**Design Movement:** Industrial Minimalism meets Technical Blueprint

**Core Principles:**
- Raw, honest materials palette reflecting plumbing trade authenticity
- Technical precision in typography and grid alignment
- High contrast between dark backgrounds and bright accent elements
- Exposed structure philosophy - showing the "bones" of the design

**Color Philosophy:**
- Primary: Deep navy (#0A1628) - represents water depth and professionalism
- Secondary: Copper/Bronze (#B87333) - nods to traditional plumbing materials
- Accent: Electric cyan (#00D4FF) - represents clean water and modernity
- Neutral: Warm concrete gray (#8B8B8B)
- Emotional intent: Trust through industrial strength, reliability through precision

**Layout Paradigm:**
- Asymmetric split-screen layouts with 60/40 divisions
- Floating cards that appear to "hover" over blueprint-style backgrounds
- Diagonal section dividers suggesting pipe angles
- Left-heavy navigation with right-side content focus

**Signature Elements:**
- Subtle grid pattern overlay reminiscent of technical drawings
- Copper pipe accent lines as section dividers
- Hexagonal icons (referencing pipe fittings)

**Interaction Philosophy:**
- Mechanical, precise movements - elements slide into place like fitting pipes
- Hover states reveal "underneath" layers
- Click feedback feels solid and tactile

**Animation:**
- Entrance animations: Elements slide in from edges with slight bounce
- Scroll triggers: Sections fade up with 0.3s ease-out
- Hover: Cards lift with shadow deepening, 0.2s transition
- Water ripple effect on CTA buttons

**Typography System:**
- Display: Bebas Neue (bold, industrial)
- Body: Source Sans Pro (clean, technical readability)
- Hierarchy: 72px hero / 48px section / 24px body / 14px caption

- Emotional intent: Cleanliness, reliability, refreshing service

**Layout Paradigm:**
- Wave-shaped section dividers creating visual flow
- Overlapping circular elements suggesting water droplets
- Card layouts with generous padding and rounded corners
- Content flows top-left to bottom-right like reading water

**Signature Elements:**
- SVG wave dividers between sections
- Water droplet icons and subtle bubble animations
- Gradient overlays on images suggesting water reflection
- Rounded, pill-shaped buttons

**Interaction Philosophy:**

## Selected Approach: Idea 3 - Trade Craft Heritage Aesthetic

I am selecting the **Trade Craft Heritage Aesthetic** for this project because:

1. It aligns with the local Australian plumbing business identity
2. The warm, approachable feel suits a service-based business
3. The eucalyptus green and burnt orange palette is distinctive without being generic
4. The strong information hierarchy supports the SEO and communication goals
5. The craftsman ethos reflects the licensed plumber's professional pride
